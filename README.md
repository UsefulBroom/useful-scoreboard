# Useful Scoreboard

Here is a simple little project that uses Next, Tailwind, React-Query, and Prisma. Login and get your name put on the Scoreboard. Its cool because its first project where I get to build stuff for the back-end too. It's going to be a fun little project, so if you are just tuning in I have a Wiki created to help follow along with updates and changes.


Each Milestone will be posted to the Wiki, I will have a referance located below, but I'm not digging into details here. 

## Updates:
