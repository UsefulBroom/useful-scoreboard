# Useful Scoreboard

Here is a simple little project that uses Next, Tailwind, React-Query, and Prisma. Login and get your name put on the Scoreboard. Its cool because its first project where I get to build stuff for the back-end too. It's going to be a fun little project, so if you are just tuning in I have a Wiki created to help follow along with updates and changes.


Each Milestone will be posted to the Wiki, I will have a referance located below, but I'm not digging into details here. 

## Updates:

6/8/2022 Update 1.0.1:<br>
Design Templete completed

6/13/2022 Update: <br>
I spent the last couple days doing some research. A few of the languages I'm trying to incorperate are totally new to me. I am hoping to get a 'placeholder' up and running tomorrow. This week is kind of heavy on homework so I'll keep things posted here.

6/14/2022 Update: <br>
I stood up Next.JS, Tailwind, and React-Query. In install only, I also built a dev branch but there isn't really any thing to show yet. So, I'm keeping it locally until I get something framed up.
